# Robot-Young-
Young robot: The aim of this project is to design and build a robot. The intended purpose of the final product is for it to be placed in facility reception areas (i.e hotels, hospitals, clubhouses, etc.) in order to help visitors find their destinations within the respective facilities. The interaction between the user and the robot should be simple enough in order for it to be approachable.
